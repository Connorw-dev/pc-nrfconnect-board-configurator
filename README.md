nRF Connect Board Configurator is an application that you can use to update the
configuration of the board controller on Nordic Development kits. The board
controller is the firmware running on the Interface MCU that controls the
behavior of the DK.

**Note:** The current Board Configurator version is experimental. This means
that the application is incomplete in functionality and will change in the
future.
